This application should be able to offer anyone who is connected by wifi to the phone where it is installed to access a certain folder for reading.


**********     V1 specifications     **********

The application generates a web page to send to the connected device trying to access any page on internet.
The generated page contains a list of links to the files inside the defined folder (/sdcard/piratebox).

The application HMI should provide a way to enable / disable the system.

The wifi hotspot management is not within the scope of this version.


**********     V2 specifications     **********

When enabled, the application will generate a wifi hotspot with a custom name (ie P1r4t3b0x).
The application should be able to reset the parameters to their original value when the application is disabled.


**********     V3 specifications     **********

The files located on other devices should be annotated on the webpage (for instance with the mention "remote located")
If a client ask for a remote located file, the application must download the application from its original source and provide this downloaded file to
the client. The application should transfer the file gradually as it is received.
An option should allow the user to specify if the downloaded remote file should be kept in the shared folder or not.
