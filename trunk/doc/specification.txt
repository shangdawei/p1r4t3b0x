- The application is able to look for other P1r4t3b0x networks and add their files to its list. (checkbox option)
The files located on other devices should be annotated on the webpage (for instance with the mention "remote located")
If a client ask for a remote located file, the application must download the application from its original source and provide this downloaded file to
the client. The application should transfer the file gradually as it is received.
An option should allow the user to specify if the downloaded remote file should be kept in the shared folder or not.

- Bluetooth scan + send file "turnWifiOn.html" > Hey, you received that because you are in range of a free wifi connection to a piratebox. A piratebox is a device where you can connect to and download files. To connect to the piratebox, follow those simple steps:
1- turn your wifi on
2- connect to a wifi network called P1R4T3B0X
3- open your navigator and try to go to any website
4- you are redirected to the piratebox home page, where you can see the list of the files available for download.

You can turn your android device into a piratebox too ! You just need to download and install the P1R4T3B0X application (link)
