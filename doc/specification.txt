**********     Later specifications     **********

- The application is able to look for other P1r4t3b0x networks and add their files to its list. (checkbox option)
The files located on other devices should be annotated on the webpage (for instance with the mention "remote located")
If a client ask for a remote located file, the application must download the application from its original source and provide this downloaded file to
the client. The application should transfer the file gradually as it is received.
An option should allow the user to specify if the downloaded remote file should be kept in the shared folder or not.
